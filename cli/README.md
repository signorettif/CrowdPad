# CrowdPad `cli`

The CrowdPad `cli` is a Python daemon that listens for incoming messages from the CrowdPad `server`, aggregates the crowd's input commands within a configurable interval, and then sends the most-voted input to a virtual gamepad device on your local computer. This allows large numbers of users to collaboratively control a game or software by submitting commands through the CrowdPad `app`, with the `cli` handling local input emulationâ€”ideal for events like "Twitch Plays" or crowdsourced gaming experiments.

## Options

| `--stubController`      | Use a stubbed implementation to simulate inputs (flag). | `False` |
| `--delay`               | Delay in milliseconds before sending the input.         | `0`     |

## Setup

### Ubuntu (tested on `25.04`)

To run the application without requiring `sudo`, you need to grant your user permission to access the `uinput` device.

1.  **Add your user to the `input` group:**

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG input $USER
    ```

2.  **Create a udev rule for `uinput`:**

    ```bash
    echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules
    ```

3.  **Reload the udev rules:**

    ```bash
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    sudo udevadm trigger
    ```

4.  **Log out and log back in:**
    For the group changes to take effect, you need to log out of your current session and log back in.

After following these steps, you can run the application without `sudo`.
